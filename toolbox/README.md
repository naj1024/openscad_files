Remix of source scad file to allow different box sizes. Basic length, width and depth changes are now easier. 

Remixed from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2969508

Uploaded new scad file with lip on bottomhalf and text on top half. Renamed things.

 V1.0    - First release after remix
 V1.1    - Added lip on bottom half
 V1.2    - Added text on lid and code tidy up
 V1.3    - Bug fix: bottom was 2* wall_thickness.
 V1.4    - Openscad customizer (View->Customizer (unhide))
 V1.4.1 - Variable latch width 
 V1.4.2 - Fix for thingiverse customiser not supporting true/false

Not tried different wall thicknesses, but should work - the hinge setting will be the bit that fails so examine closely if you change the wall thickness.

Added basic functions, modules, for the different parts so 'may' be easier to modify in the future.

Option to add a lip on the bottom half. Makes for a really tight fit when lid closed.

Option to put some engraved text on the top.

Hinge works well, seems sturdy and latch is a good fit.

STL files: 
=======
flybox:135mm length by 90mm width and each half is 14mm height.

toolbox: 135mm by 90mm by 18mm each half, with lip and text of 'tools'.

All dimensions are outside with a 2mm wall thickness.
